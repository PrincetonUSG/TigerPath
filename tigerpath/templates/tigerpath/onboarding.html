            <p>TigerPath is a tool, and is not a replacement for talking with your academic advisor. The official decision for whether or not a particular schedule fulfills your graduation requirements always rests with the university.</p>
            <p>We recommend using TigerPath to plan out your schedule and then double-checking with your advisor to make sure that your schedule is reasonable and satisfies all of the requirements you want to satisfy.</p>
            <p>TigerPath is currently in beta. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, we would appreciate your <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/T0pnhwdBYIS8mM6q1" target="_blank">feedback</a>!</p>
