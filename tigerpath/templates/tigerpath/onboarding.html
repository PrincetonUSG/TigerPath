            <h6>Prepopulate your course schedule (Optional)</h6>
            <p>If you're interested in prepopulating your four-year course schedule with courses you've already taken, then you can upload your official transcript to the TigerApps Transcript Service.</p>
            <p>Once you click on "Continue with Transcript Service" below, you will be redirected to the TigerApps Transcript Service webpage. Check "Share Courses", upload your official transcript as a PDF file, and click the submit button. The service will extract the courses you've taken, and we'll automatically put them into your schedule.</p>
            <p>Using the Transcript Service is optional. If you'd like, you can click "Finish" below and populate your schedule manually.</p>
