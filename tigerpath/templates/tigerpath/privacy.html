        <p>The goal of TigerPath is to help you more efficiently and easily plan out what courses to take so that you can fulfill all of your requirements and graduate on time. In order to provide you with this service, we gather certain kinds of data from Princeton University and from you (the user). We also use some third-party services that could gather data about you. </p>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy, and we try to be as transparent as possible about how we handle data in TigerPath. The purpose of this privacy policy is to help you understand what kinds of data we collect and what we use them for.</p>

      <div class="text-section">
        <h4>Authentication</h4>
        <p>We protect the entire application underneath CAS authentication, which is the same system you use to sign into other Princeton services, like TigerHub.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section">
        <h4>User Data</h4>
        <p>Your data is stored securely. We will never give or sell your data to third parties, or allow other users or nonusers access to your data without your explicit permission. We only store the data that we need to in order to provide you with the best experience possible in TigerPath. This data includes your nickname, class year, major, and four-year course schedule. By using TigerPath, you are consenting to the storage of this data.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section">
        <h4>University Data</h4>
        <p>We collect the course listings data from the OIT Web Feed Registry and the Course Offerings webpage, and we compile the requirements information from the Princeton University Undergraduate Announcement website and the official Princeton University department websites.</p>
        <p>We endeavor to make the displayed course listings and requirements information as accurate as possible. However, errors do occur occasionally, and sometimes the course listings and requirements change before we are able to update them. Therefore, we make no guarantees about the accuracy of our data. The definitive source of data will always come from the university administration and departments; if you are in doubt about the veracity of any university data on our app, you should contact them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section">
        <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
        <p>We use some third-party services in order to make your experience better:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>TigerBook API, to automatically populate your name, class year, and major.</li>
          <li>TigerApps Transcript API, to help you prepopulate your course schedule with courses you've already taken.</li>
          <li>Google Analytics, to collect aggregated anonymous metadata on how you use the app so we can continually improve it.</li>
