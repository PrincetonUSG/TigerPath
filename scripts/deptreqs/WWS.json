      "explanation": "There are four prerequisites for concentrating in the Woodrow Wilson School:\n1. A course in Statistics\n2. A course in Microeconomics\n3. A course in History\n4. A course in Politics, Sociology or Psychology\nPrerequisites must be completed prior to the beginning of the fall term of the junior year.\nAll courses taken to meet these prerequisites must be taken on a graded basis (no pass/D/fail). AP courses or freshman seminars may not be used to fulfill prerequisites. Students must receive a grade of C minus or higher in all courses used as prerequisites.  One course cannot be used to fulfill more than one prerequisite.\n\nAll courses that meet prerequisites must be taken before September of the junior year. A summer course or a course taken abroad can be used to meet a WWS prerequisite if the course is certified by the relevant department as equivalent to one of the courses offered at Princeton that would meet the prerequisite and the course is approved for Princeton credit. No more than two prerequisites may be taken over the summer. Any course taken outside of Princeton to meet the statistics prerequisite must also be approved by the WWS Undergraduate Program Office (approval is granted only for special circumstances).\nA course taken at Princeton and used as a prerequisite can also be used to meet either a WWS core requirement (if it is on the list of core requirements) or as a WWS elective (if it is on the electives list).",
